# üìö Library Management System

A Library Management System built using concepts of OOPS(Object-Oriented Programming) in C++ Programming Language. This is made using a whole lot of concepts in OOPS such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation. This system manages students, faculty and librarians with essential library functionalities and file-baseddata persistance.

**If you are testing this code, It already has 10 books, 5 students, 3 faculties and a librarian. You can remove them and create your whole new library, books, users, accounts for students, faculty and librarian.**

## Features

‚úÖ Multi-role support (Students, Faculty, Librarians)  
‚úÖ Book borrowing system with timestamps  
‚úÖ Fine management with payment options  
‚úÖ Easy tracking of overdue books and borrowing history  
‚úÖ Librarian tools for book and user management  
‚úÖ File-based data persistence for secure storage 

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akilteja-1625/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System
```

## Run Instructions

Option 1: Compile & Run on Linux (Recommended)

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o library_system  # Compiles the file
./library_system  # Runs the compiled executable
```

Option 2: Compile & Run on Windows (Using MinGW)

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o library_system.exe  # Compiles the file
library_system.exe  # Runs the compiled executable
```

## Data Format

**In book Class**

title - string
author - string
publisher - string
year - integer
ISBN - string(**unique for every book**)
status - boolean(**0 - not available & 1 - available**)

**In Account Class**

borrowedBooks - vector of class book(i.e it is an array of book objects)
dueDate - is an unordered map where key is ISBN and value id due Date
borrowedDate - is an unordered map where key is ISBN and value id borrowed Date
returnDate - is an unordered map where key is ISBN and value id return Date
fineAmount - it has fine calculated for the student(i.e every user has a account)

**In user Class**

name - string
userID - int
email - string
phoneNumber - string
userType - string(i.e either "Student" or "Faculty" or "Librarian")
every user has an account.

**In Library Class**

books - vector of books(i.e an array of book objects which are stored in library)
users - is an unordered map where key is userID and value is the address of user(to avoid creating copies of memory and making the code inefficient)

**In student class**

It is derived from user class.
maxBooks - it is constant integer and can't exceed 3 for an student
Every student has to pay fine if his books are in overdue period 

**In Faculty class**

It is derived from user class.
maxBooks - it is constant integer and can't exceed 5 for an faculty

**In Librarian class**

It is derived from user class.
He is the only one who has access to add Books, remove Books, add users and remove users in our library management system.
He cannot borrow or return books like student and faculty.

**Books.csv**
It retains the data of books with it's availability status. when we terminate the program and when ever we run the program again it uses the data retained by this file to maintain integrity of our library management system.

**Users.csv**
It retains the data of users who are newly added and removed from our system. when we terminate the program and when ever we run the program again it uses the data retained by this file to maintain integrity of our library management system.

**Transactions.csv**
It retains the data of transactions i.e the book taken by which user and the time of borrow and the time of return. when we terminate the program and when ever we run the program again it uses the data retained by this file to maintain integrity of our library management system.
